## Hello!

I'm sure that this repo is probably not quite what you were expecting. After the exciting back-and-forth with deprecated dependencies for the localhost and confirming whether the logging error in `Main.java` was expected, I tinkered around in the client interface for a bit before the weekend. I immediately knew what sort of tests would be useful, and I was feeling confident

That confidence quickly slipped away once I actually sat down on Monday and opened up IntelliJ. I have never worked with Maven before, so I was unsure how to proceed. Additionally, I have no experience with React and my knowledge of API interfacing (get, set, post) is pretty rusty at best. I don't believe this was a major factor, but I still feel it's worth noting that I am also rather new to the IntelliJ IDE

I spent a couple hours trying to figure out unit testing in Maven, but I couldn't quite get anything working in my IDE. I also spent about an hour refreshing myself on the fundamentals of API stuff. Will need more studying/exposure for it to really stick in my brain, but I was able to better understand what was going on in the project repo

At this point, I realized that I was running out of time and had nothing to show for the "behind the scenes" work I had done. So at the very least, I documented my train of thought and laid out what I planned to do. It's not full-on unit tests, but it is a glimpse into my thought process when it comes to problem solving

## What I Did
Despite the setbacks above, I still made a few changes and additions to the repo 
- In `Distributors.java` and `Inventory.java`, I updated the filepaths to workbooks I created
- In `/server/resources`, I added two workbooks with custom data that I created for various tests. This is paired with the addition below
- In the main folder, I uploaded a word doc outlining all of the tests that I would create. This is paired with the addition above
- In the main folder, I also uploaded a sample output of what test results could look like. At my current company, the PowerPoint creation/capture is built into our test scripts so that we can conveniently capture all of the evidence that we need. Results reporting may look very different at TopBloc, though; so this may be irrelevant


## Next Steps

I completely understand that it's difficult to assess someone's competency and coding skills on what essentially boils down to "just trust me." But I'm still confident that I would excel in this role once I have a better, guided crash course on Maven testing and once I am able to get more comfortable with React. I pride myself in being a fast learner in a supportive environment, and I hope to still have the opportunity to prove that to y'all

If my results of the coding challenge are still a dealbreaker, it was lovely to meet you all and I wish you the best in finding the ideal candidate for this awesome opportunity! :)
